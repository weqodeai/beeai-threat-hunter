# Epic 5: Threat Intelligence Integration

## Epic Overview
Implement comprehensive threat intelligence integration supporting both internal and external TI sources to enrich security event analysis and improve threat detection accuracy.

## Epic Goals
- Integrate with external threat intelligence platforms
- Support internal threat intelligence feeds
- Implement IOC enrichment and validation
- Create threat intelligence correlation capabilities

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] External TI sources (MISP, OTX, VirusTotal, Shodan) are integrated
- [ ] Internal TI feed ingestion is functional
- [ ] IOC enrichment provides relevant context and scoring
- [ ] Threat actor attribution and campaign tracking works
- [ ] False positive reduction through TI validation is effective
- [ ] Performance meets requirements with high TI query volumes
- [ ] TI data freshness and accuracy is maintained
- [ ] API rate limiting and cost optimization is implemented
